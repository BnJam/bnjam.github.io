title: Anomaly Detection with SDAE
---

Anomaly detection is a prominent data preprocessing step in learning applications for correction and/or removal of faulty data. Automating this data type with the use of autoencoders could increasethe quality of the dataset by isolating anomalies that were missed through manual or basic statistic alanalysis. A Simple, Deep, and Supervised Deep Autoencoder were trained and compared for anomaly detection over the ASHRAE building energy dataset. Given the restricted parameters under which the models were trained, the Deep Autoencoder perfoms the best, however, the Supervised Deep Autoencoder outperforms the other models in total anomalies detected when considerations for the test datasets are given.
